# README - Floating Audio Player

Adaptation of Dallas Morning News audio bug. Forked from @jdhancock88.

Plugin introduces an unobtrusive audio player that lives in the bottom right corner of viewport. On scrolling through set ranges on the page the audio files are interchanged to fit story context.

### TODO

* Add notification on audio/title change.
* Fix/remove icky CSS
